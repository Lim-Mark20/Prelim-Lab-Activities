      <p class="profile-text">
        I am an enthusiastic and dedicated student with a strong passion for web development and digital innovation.
        Currently i am honing my skills in both frontend and backend,
        I aim to build responsive, user-friendly websites and applications that make a real impact.
        My goal is to become a backend web developer, to gain a better understanding in server-side technologies, databases, and API integrations to create robust and scalable systems.
        I’m eager to contribute to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and continuously grow in this fast-evolving field.
